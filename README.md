# 3D Plane Game

A browser-based 3D plane game where you control a fighter plane to shoot down UFOs hovering over a city, built with Three.js.

## Requirements

### Browser Requirements
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Chrome 60+, Firefox 55+, Safari 12+, or Edge 79+
- Hardware acceleration enabled

### System Requirements
- Minimum 4GB RAM
- Dedicated graphics card recommended
- Stable internet connection for initial asset loading

### Dependencies
- Three.js (latest stable version)
- Modern JavaScript (ES6+) support
- HTML5 Audio API support
- WebGL 2.0 support

## Tech Stack

### Core Technologies
- **Three.js** - 3D graphics rendering and scene management
- **JavaScript (ES6+ Modules)** - Game logic and modular architecture
- **HTML5** - Canvas and DOM structure
- **CSS3** - UI styling and responsive design
- **WebGL** - Hardware-accelerated 3D rendering

### Audio & Effects
- **HTML5 Audio API** - Sound effects and background music
- **Three.js Particle System** - Explosions and visual effects

### Architecture
- **Modular Design** - Separate modules for different game components
- **Component-Based** - Reusable game objects and systems

```

## Getting Started

1. Clone or download the project
2. Open `index.html` in a modern web browser
3. Ensure hardware acceleration is enabled
4. Use keyboard/mouse controls to pilot the plane and eliminate UFOs

## Controls (To be implemented)
- **W/S** - Throttle up/down
- **A/D** - Roll left/right  
- **Mouse** - Pitch and yaw
- **Space** - Fire weapons
- **ESC** - Pause/Menu
